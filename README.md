- [ ] [Small screen sizes](#small-screen-size-improvements)
- [ ] Sidebar lower section

- [x] techlogo images size consistency
- [x] techlogo images caption instead of image with words (and contrast issues)
- [x] techlogo images zoom in and display alt text in little popup bubble on hover
- [ ] p text gets too long and looks bad. Max at 75ch? 100ch? Time to research typography

### Small Screen Size Improvements

- [ ] Move the sidebar to an expandable menu at the top below 667 px width
- [ ] Adjust techlogo image size to fill the space when in single-column layout
- [ ] Images are very small at small sizes, consider adjusting margins?

- [ ] Fix text run-on in small sizes

### Large Screen Size Improvements

- [ ] Make nav headers and links bigger
- [ ] Above a certain width, move the image to the side (2-column layout)
- [ ] Above a certain width, move the project blocks be all in one row (3-column layout)

### About Page Improvements

- [x] .NET and DNN are breaking out of their box
- [x] White looks bad
- [x] Fix colors in light mode
- [x] Cloudflare refuses to be vertically centered
- [x] Hover over for an explanation of what it is/is used for
- [x] Click to go to that tech's website (such as click on the DNN logo to go to [DotNetNuke](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/))
- [ ] Hover/Focus border has a gap at the bottom
- [ ] Add an arrow to signal where the tooltip is coming from
- [ ] Assess the accessability of tooltips

### Projects Page Improvements

- [ ] Split the "on this page" section to websites, desktop apps, mobile apps, AddOns/mods, hardware, etc.
- [ ] Add GitHub links to the projects' repos
- [ ] Add other relevant links to the projects, such as the website link, ESOUI link, etc.
- [ ] Add the rest of my projects.
- [ ] Same issue as the homepage with the projects - looks bad on screens wider than taller.
- [x] Google Analytics is breaking out of its box
- [ ] Visual Studio is smaller than the rest of the techlogos.
- [ ] Techlogos are taking the focus away from the project. Are they too big? Wrong color?

### Contact Page Improvements

- [ ] Other methods of contacting (PGP key?)

### Code Cleanup Steps

- [ ] Remove ununsed classes
- [ ] Make HTML and general layout consistent between pages
- [ ] Clean up and organize CSS
